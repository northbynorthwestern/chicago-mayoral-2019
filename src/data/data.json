He served as CEO of Chicago Public Schools (CPS) between 1996 and 2001. Vallas’ work in Chicago made him a nationally recognized figure in education - he was subsequently hired in Philadelphia and New Orleans to turn around public schools. \n</p><p>Whether Vallas’ tenure at CPS was successful is still hotly debated. Vallas opened up new sources of funding for CPS, balancing the system’s budget over his six-year tenure. More contentiously, he oversaw a rapid expansion in alternative, charter and selective enrollment schools, which send a considerable number each year to Northwestern. Selective enrollment schools are public schools which determine admission based on test scores; they have been criticized for being disproportionately wealthy and white, using government funds to further privilege Chicago’s elite. </p><p>In person, Vallas is articulate and wonkish. His campaign has attempted to brand him as a disinterested fixer - his most common bumper sticker reads PAUL SOLVES PROBLEMS. He has run twice for elected office in Illinois - for governor in 2004 and lieutenant governor in 2014, both times unsuccessfully. But he does not possess the buzzword charisma of a successful politician, preferring instead to wade into the weeds of policy in speeches and mayoral fora. </p>","Issue 1 Title":"Housing","Issue 1 Blurb":"Vallas wants to cap individual property taxes to protect homeowners in neighborhoods threatened by gentrification. He also wants to change zoning codes to allow denser configurations of garden-unit properties.","Issue 2 Title":"Education","Issue 2 Blurb":"Vallas wants to expand early childhood programs and access to Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate. He also wants to keep schools open for longer hours.","Issue 3 Title":"Police Accountability","Issue 3 Blurb":"Vallas’ campaign has largely avoided deep discussions of police reform. While opponents such as Lori Lightfoot, Amara Enyia and John Kozlar have talked extensively about their visions for the department, police accountability gets a sentence on Vallas’ website - a bland cliche about the mayor setting the tone for transparency. One factor that may explain this is two of Vallas’ sons are officers in the Chicago Police Department, and his wife is a former policewoman.","Major Endorsements":"No major endorsements - although former Governor Bruce Rauner told the Chicago Tribune Editorial Board that Vallas “might make the best mayor in my opinion.” Vallas, sensing the political winds, has not hurried to incorporate Rauner’s name into his messaging.","Chances of Winning":"Unlikely. <p>Vallas has name recognition, even a national brand. At the same time, it is hard to campaign on a controversial record in Chicago Public Schools. He also has a limited war chest compared to his independently wealthy rivals.</p><p>It’s not clear who his base is and if they will turn out to vote for him come Election Day. The competition for progressive voters is fierce. Although he is by no means conservative, Vallas won a straw poll among Northside Republicans due to his centrist positions on school choice.  \n</p><p>Vallas currently polls at 3.7 percent, placing him sixth in a crowded field. While he could plausibly win against the right weak candidate in a runoff, it is unlikely that his next destination is \nCity Hall.\n</p>"},{"Candidate":"Willie Wilson"}]}
